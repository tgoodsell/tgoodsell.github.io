    <h3>Kepler Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Kepler respects your privacy as a donor, supporter, and visitor to our website. We pledge to keep information obtained from you, and about you, secure and to act transparently about how we use it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have questions or comments about our website or privacy policy, please email us at <a href="mailto:info@kepler.org">info@kepler.org</a>.
    </p>

    <h3>Typical Website Usage</h3>
    <p>
      During a typical visit to kepler.org, the only information collected from you is the name of your Internet Service Provider, the browser and type of computer you are using, the website that referred you, the pages you request, and the date/time of those requests. This data is used to analyze statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using kepler.org, we may collect non-personal information about you through tracking technologies such as cookies and web beacons. This may include information about your browsing actions such as the frequency with which you visit various parts of the website. We use the information collected primarily to inform our efforts to provide an enhanced experience on the website.
    </p>
    <p>
      During these visits, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, or phone number.
    </p>

    <h3>Email Signup</h3>
    <p>
      We want to contact you only if you want to hear updates about Kepler and its programs. We attempt to email only when necessary, and will always give you the option to opt out in all communications we send. We will never sell or give away your email address for a third party to contact you.
    </p>
    <p>
      We may send you service-related announcements on the rare occasions when it is necessary to do so.
    </p>

    <h3>Donating</h3>
    <p>
      When you make a donation or sign up to receive email updates, we will request personal information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and phone number. We use the information only to process your donation and for you to receive email updates, if preferred. This information is shared with third party services to perform these functions on behalf of Kepler (i.e. email marketing and payment processing services).
    </p>
    <p>
      When donating on kepler.org, we will send you an email receipt, tax acknowledgment, and thank you relating to your donation. If you have signed up for updates, you will also now receive occasional email communications from Kepler staff members, in accordance with your preferences.
    </p>

    <h3>Security</h3>
    <p>
      We try our best to protect your personal information. No security systems are perfect, however, and any transmission of personal information is done at your own risk. We will not be responsible or liable for, and will be held harmless from, any damages, losses or causes of action arising out of or in connection with the disclosure of your personally identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h3>Governing law and forum</h3>
    <p>
      You agree that your use of this site, this Privacy Policy, and any disputes relating thereto, shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Massachusetts.
